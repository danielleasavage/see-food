## Welcome to the See Food Page!

Here you will find data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations for the years 1961-2013. The visualizations we have developed are intended to paint a broader picture of where your food used to come from and where it comes from now. We hope that the spread of this information will spark conversations about sourcing food locally.

### About Us

Danielle & Khoury: We are both Master's Candidates in Data Science, and are constantly looking for ways to use our knowledge and new found skills to be change to the world one cause at a time. Both passionate about environmental and agricultural efforts, we wanted to share this publicly available data in a way everyone can understand. We hope you enjoy!

### Code

Our code is organized in 2 Jupyter notebooks. see_food_data_prep.ipynb does all data pre-processing necessary to accomplish our visualization goals in Plotly. This notebook reads in raw data FAO.csv and outputs the food_final.csv. viz_only.ipynb reads in food_final.csv and creates visualizations that are linked to the project website. All other files in the repository are for html purposes.
